%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% OBJECTIVE
%   ===> Calculate the responses of the training samples using 
%            acoustic network solver
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% INPUTS
%   ===> X: matrix, each row represents one training sample
%   ===> parameter_bound: 2 x 5 matrix, lower bound (first row) and 
%            upper bound (second row) for uncertain parameters
%   ===> N: scalar, number of impulse response coefficients
%   ===> delta_t: scalar, sampling interval of impulse response (unit: s)
%   ===> options: Display options for fsolve
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% OUTPUTS
%   ===> response: matrix, each row contains four responses
%            (ITA frequency/growth rate, CAV frequency/growth rate)
