The source code and data to reproduce the Helmholtz results in:

> S. Guo, C. F. Silva, W. Polifke. Reliable calculation of thermoacoustic instability risk using an imperfect surrogate model. ASME Turo Expo 2020, London, England

The files/folders are organized as follows:

**ErrorPf.m** + **PlotPf.m**: to visualize the performance of both methods.

**StabilityMarginExtract.m** + **StabiMarg3D_LineExp.m**: to visualize sample locaitons with respect to the stability margin 

**SolverFunctions**: Helmholtz solver utilities. 

**Calculate_resp_helmholtz.m**: Calculate the responses of the training samples using Helmholtz solver.


Pre-install UQLab (www.uqlab.com) is necessary to run the code
